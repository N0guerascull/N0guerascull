            <p>Alejandro Noguera is a 19-year-old who just graduated from high school. His journey emphasizes the young trauma of his parents' divorce, the hatred thrown from the two families generating an inner conflict on which side to trust, the use of anger as a way to cope with the unforgiving feelings towards his parents, toughness, change challenges, and self-discovery.</p>
            <p>At the tender age of 11, Alejandro already had an intense desire for productive solitude, making a bold decision to leave his home and move to Canada. However, when he returned at 13, he was met with the heartbreaking news of his parents' divorce. This event ignited the internal inferno within him, pushing him to channel his anger into something productive.</p>
            <p>Alejandro's story is one of resilience, using his anger as fuel for self-improvement. From rigorous boxing training to becoming a champion in his high school football team, his journey is a testament to the power of turning pain into strength. Despite facing numerous challenges, Alejandro continues to strive for his maximum potential, inspiring others to do the same.</p>
